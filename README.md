2. Now, create an issue for the feature, assign yourself to the issue, and [label](https://github.com/frc5587/RapidReact/labels) it accordingly
3. When you're ready to Pull Request (PR) to `development`, create a PR and [label](https://github.com/frc5587/RapidReact/labels) it accordingly. Then request a person to review your code. Once the PR has been merged, it should be closed.

2. Don't assign anyone to the issue, and label it as a ["Bug"](https://github.com/frc5587/RapidReact/labels/Bug)

*If you've found a bug, and can fix it*
